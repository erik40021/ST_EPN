## General notes
Raw and processed data used in this study can be downloaded under EGA repository (coming soon).

NMF analysis was mainly based on Gavish et al. 23 (see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06130-4 for additional reference).

Spatial analyses were conceptually inspired by Greenwald et al. 24 (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.029 for additional reference).

R version used was 4.4.1.
